# Line-Chat Bot for Yu-Gi-Oh!

## Line Messaging API
We can develop two-way communication between service and LINE users by the Messaging API.<br><br>

## How it works
1.The user sends a message to the LINE official account.<br><br>
2.The LINE Platform sends a webhook event to the webhook URL of the bot server.<br><br>
3.According to the webhook event, the bot server responds to the user through the LINE Platform.<br><br>

## Game Developed—Yu-Gi-Oh!
Have you ever heard ‘Yu-Gi-Oh’? It’s a Japanese manga series about card game.<br><br>
Gameplay: Each player starts with 8,000 "Life Points", with the main aim of the game to use monster attacks to reduce the opponent's Life Points.<br><br>
A player loses if their Life Points reaches zero.<br><br>

## Event Design
‘Yu-Gi-Oh’ is turn-based game. All of turn has one of win , lose or draw. So I have to consider every situation and set different kinds of events.<br><br>
In addition, all of card are assigned randomly. The player just presses one Botton to play. Very Simple!!<br><br>

## More Exciting
For fun. I set opponent who will cheat in game. It lets the gameplay have more challenges. :D<br><br>
